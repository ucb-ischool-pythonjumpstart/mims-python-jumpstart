# Python Bootcamp 

Welcome! This is the introduction to working with python and other pieces of the data science compute stack. 
This readme is just a stub for now, because you all are going to help build it out through our time together. 

# UCB DataHub 

We're using the DataHub as our virtual, cloud computing environment. Every day, when we start class - we can click [this link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fucb-ischool-pythonjumpstart%2Fmims-python-jumpstart&urlpath=tree%2Fmims-python-jumpstart%2F&branch=master) which will copy over today's lesson into the DataHub.

Once we've copied the files, if we want to return to our saved work we can go directly to the DataHub: ( [https://datahub.berkeley.edu](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/) ) and navigate to mims-python-jumpstart folder.

# Materials
Most of the Jupyternotebooks we will use are from the Ischool W200 course. However, we may occasionally also use resources from the Berkeley D-Lab.

## D-Lab Python Fundamentals 
In addition to W200, we will also work from a few notebooks from the Berkeley D-Lab. Make sure to checkout their great resources and workshops on campus! See their [Current Trainings | D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training) to sign up for workshops.

To run the lessons, we can copy the files into our DataHub by clicking [this link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2Fpython-fundamentals&urlpath=tree%2Fpython-fundamentals%2F) . If we want to revisit our saved work, we can login to DataHub directly ( [https://datahub.berkeley.edu](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/) ), sign in, and you click on the python-fundamentals folder which contains the DLab lessons.

## Relationship between W200 public & private repositories 

There is a little bit of a dose-e-doe that we have to do to manage the repositories right now. Here's why: We have a lot of content that we built for w200 that we are using as a jump start. We want to make sure that this content stays locked up, as much as possible. 
However, to abstract away some of the low-level work to build a working python environment, we've opted to use the UCB Datahub. This requires, for specific reasons, that we use a public repository. And so, here's where we stand: 

- There is a private repository that you all have access to that is on the enterprise server -- you should think of this as the source of truth. 
- There is also a public, stripped down repository that has _some_ (but not all) of the work that is in this private repo. In this public is just the work that we want you to do on the UCB Datahub. 

We will, to the best of our ability, manage this so that you don't have to deal with it. There might be times that it breaks; we'll fix it though.
