# Python Bootcamp 

Welcome! This is the introduction to working with python and other pieces of the data science compute stack. 
This readme is just a stub for now, because you all are going to help build it out through our time together. 

# UCB Datahub

# Relationship between repositories 

There is a little bit of a dose-e-doe that we have to do to manage the repositories right now. Here's why: We have a lot of content that we built for w200 that we are using as a jump start. We want to make sure that this content stays locked up, as much as possible. 
However, to abstract away some of the low-level work to build a working python environment, we've opted to use the UCB Datahub. This requires, for specific reasons, that we use a public repository. And so, here's where we stand: 

- There is a private repository that you all have access to that is on the enterprise server -- you should think of this as the source of truth. 
- There is also a public, stripped down repository that has _some_ (but not all) of the work that is in this private repo. In this public is just the work that we want you to do on the UCB Datahub. 

We will, to the best of our ability, manage this so that you don't have to deal with it. There might be times that it breaks; we'll fix it though.
