    "A loop is a control structure that allows statements to be executed multiple times.  The uses for loops in data science are endless.  We may want to perform an operation on every entry in a data table.  We may want to process a user request, then prepare for the next request to come in.  We may want to keep guessing at model coefficents that fit a data set until the accuracy we get is good enough.  In fact, almost all interesting algorithms we will implement involve loops in some way. Python provides two main ways to create loops: the `while` statement and the `for` statement.  We'll examine while loops in this lesson and look at for loops later."

    "When control reaches the `while` statement for the first time, it evaluates the expression after the `while` keyword. This is called the looping condition. If it evaluates to True, control then enters the indented `while` code suite and executes it. When this is done, control goes back up to the `while` statement and reevaluates the looping condition. As long as the condition evaluates to True, the process repeats. If, however, the condition evaluates to False, control skips the indented `while` suite and proceeds to the rest of the program.\n",

Our strategy will be to start with a guess of zero and test to see if  squaring it gives the right answer. If not, we will add one to our guess and try squaring it again. We can stop looping when the square of our guess exceeds the number we are aiming for. This is shown in the following program."
