### Breakout 1: Echo

#### 1.3.1 Exercises 
1. Write a command that prints out the string “hello, world”. Extra credit: As in Listing 1.2, do it two different ways, both with and without using quotation marks.

2. Type the command echo 'hello (with a mismatched single quote), and then get out of trouble using the technique from Box 1.4.

#### 1.5.1
1. Using the up arrow, print to the screen the strings “fee”, “fie”, “foe”, and “fum” without retyping echo each time.

2. Starting with the line in Listing 1.7, use any combination of ⌃A, ⌃E, arrow keys, or Option-click to change the occurrences of the short s to the archaic long s “ſ” in order to match the appearance of the original (Figure 1.11). In other words, the argument to echo should read “FRom faireſt creatures we deſire increaſe,”. Hint: It’s unlikely that your keyboard can produce “ſ” natively, so either copy it from the text of this tutorial or Google for it and copy it from the Internet. (If you have trouble copying and pasting into your terminal, I suggest applying the ideas in Box 1.5 to figure out how to do it on your system.)

#### 1.6.1
1. Clear the contents of the current tab.

2. Open a new tab, execute echo 'hello', and then exit.
